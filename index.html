        <h1> Hello there! My name is Calvin Mitchell, and I'm a fourth-year computer information systems major from Homestead, FL.
          I've had my hands on the internet and technology for as long as I can remember. My first interaction with any kind of big tech,
          other than my mom's Samsung Galaxy S III, was a bulky, white Dell(?) computer that my babysitter owned. She couldn't use it much because
          it used a lot of electricity in their home, so the one video I remember vividly is LMFAO's - I'm Sexy and I Know It on YouTube during it's
          heyday. She showed me more videos and Flash games that could never run on my mom's old laptop. After that, I fell in love with the computer, and it introduced me to a world that I never thought existed in my young mind, and here we are. Currently, I'm working on an at-home media and file-dumping server for my own use. It's simply for easily accessing files without storing them locally, but I'm still figuring out the kinks. Other
          projects I've worked on are a natural disaster relief AI program that I believe could be a game-changer, but it's still in its infancy  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. </h1>
